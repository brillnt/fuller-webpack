# Command Center Animation Development Prompt

## Project Overview
I'm developing a dynamic animation for a command center interface using GSAP. The animation features 8 tiles arranged in a perimeter around a central "brain" tile in a 3x3 grid. I need help evolving this animation from its current state to something more fluid, organic, and visually interesting.

## Current Implementation
My animation has progressed through two key versions:

1. **Basic Movement Version**: Tiles move clockwise/counterclockwise around the perimeter of the grid.
   - Discovered DOM order vs. visual position mapping issue
   - Fixed with explicit position mapping in `moveTargets` array
   - Implemented staggered movements with varying timing

2. **Intelligent Network Concept**: Currently exploring this enhanced version with:
   - Four movement patterns (clockwise, counterclockwise, pair swaps, pattern groups)
   - SVG connection lines between tiles that animate in/out
   - Random processing "pulses" on individual tiles
   - Center "brain" tile that periodically influences other tiles

## Technical Details
- Grid layout follows this structure, with each number representing tile index in DOM order:
```
   [0][1][2]
   [3][ ][4]  (center excluded)
   [5][6][7]
```
- Movements must account for this specific DOM structure
- Animation features need to respect the current position of each tile
- Currently using GSAP for all animations with standard DOM/SVG manipulation

## Additional Animation Concepts
Beyond the Intelligent Network, we've developed two other promising concepts:

1. **Resonance Cascade System**: 
   - Tiles oscillate subtly from the center
   - "Cascade events" trigger chain reactions of movements
   - Each tile's movement influences nearby tiles with decreasing intensity
   - Elastic/bounce easing creates satisfying rhythmic quality
   - Direction of cascade flows periodically reverses

2. **Quantum State Observer**:
   - Tiles occasionally split into semi-transparent "ghost" versions
   - SVG morphing between different visual states
   - "Entanglement" effects where tiles mirror each other
   - Periodic "collapse" moments where animation pauses before resolving to new states
   - Subtle color shifts indicating different energy states

## Next Steps
I'd like to continue refining these animation concepts or explore additional ideas that:
1. Create fluid, somewhat unpredictable movement
2. Maintain a "command center" aesthetic
3. Look visually interesting and engaging
4. Use modern animation techniques within my current technical framework

When I share my code, please focus on enhancing the animation concepts while maintaining the technical approach I've established.
